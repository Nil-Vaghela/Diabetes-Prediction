Steps we have done so far
    - Gathered Clinical data
    - Apple watch raw data
    - Converted XML into csv
    - Merged all the data types into one csv file for better use and understanding
    - Gathered 50 patient data where 30 are diabetic and 20 are not



Steps we have to do now:
    - Create model to predict diabetes from Clinical Data
    - Make a transformation model to convert apple data to clinical understable data
    - Run model on different patien to find out diabetes

    

Data File to Use:

For Clinical Data:
    -diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv

For apple watch to predict 
    -Patients_90days
